This is an assignment of FreeCode camp which I made it is completely responsive. The technology used in its development iclude HTML and CSS. 

# Fluid Screen Sizes
To make a fixed width box we use "px" value in width
But if we want a fluid or responsive width box that change with screen size use "%" as unit  

# Centering the div 
To make a div place in centre of the screen we use two properties 
margin-left: auto;
margin-right:auto;

# Background Image 
In order to use an image as a background, we use the body tag and give it the property of 
background-image: url(https://cdn......jpg)

# Article 
This tag of HTML contains multiple elements that have related information.

# Inline-Block 
Every block level element takes up entire column of the html page, due to which other elements are unable to enter next to the previous element. They have to start from the next line. With the following property applied on the parent of two block level element we can make them inline
display: inline=block

# Making the element spread on ends
To make the text of p elements move at both ends of the columns provide width of 50% to each of them.
Make sure to place both the elements in the same line to provide space completely.
